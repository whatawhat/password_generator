## Introduction
This is a password generator where a person can choose the number of characters they'd like (between 8-128) and. They can choose from upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. There will be at least one character from each category they selected. The password will then generate.

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about if statements and variables. The most challenging was the Math.floor property which wasn't the easist and still a little tricky for me.

## Future Plans
Even though this assignment is completed, I'd like to see this become accessible to those who are visually impaired. I would like to see if the alert boxes are accessible. It would also be nice to have the user be able to choose the special characters because I've seen some password requests state that certain symbols can't be used. It would be nice for the user to pick the characters that can be chosen.
